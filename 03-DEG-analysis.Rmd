# DEG analysis {#deg-analysis}

The main purpose of this step is to reduce the number of total genes to be considered for the next steps of the process. We assume that the genes acting as early warnings will be in the selected differentially expressed genes.

To simplify, we only have two groups: infected and control (not infected). We can do the selection of these most variant genes with two methods:

1) Selecting at each time point the genes that are differently expressed: **Wald Test for GLM coeffincients**. Next, working with the join set, i.e., all the genes that have been selected as DE in any timepoint.


2) Select the genes that act deferentially across the timepoints: **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) for GLMs**. 

The idea is that most of them will overlap, later on I may decide to use only one of the methods, the data will tell.
