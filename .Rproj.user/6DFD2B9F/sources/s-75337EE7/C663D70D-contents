Previous conditions:

- Viral infection time series data available        
- At least 4 time points       
- Control non infected for each time point      
- Preferably RNA-seq but we will study the microarray data previously selected by Juan Carlos and Santiago.

I will start by the RNA-seq data, and adding the datasets following the chronology of their analysis.
